# Baby Growth System

This project was created with use of CRA (create-react-app).

## Description of the project
The project should be used for tracking your baby measurements (height and weight) in order to make your doctor's visit the more efficient and faster.

This project is an example of typical **CRUD** app.
We did not develop any backend due to using **Firebase - Cloud Database** in order to avoid any backend stuff.

For the example of cloud functions you can view **functions** folder, it is just a simple example of using Cloud Functions. And in this case I use it in order to get the console.log message, that the new document was added by our user.

For **hosting** I also used **Firebase**, while I am using their Cloud Database, so this approach is quite acceptable.\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
